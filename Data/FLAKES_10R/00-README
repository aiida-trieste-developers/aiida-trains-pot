					   EVEN numero di elettroni (EVEN/ODD)
					   
 H_sponge_G-C-C214-H72-94-EVEN.pdb         Cleaned structure and with H, but NOT Optimized
 
 raw_flake_G-94.pdb                        Directly from the selection, NOT Cleaned


Cleaned Structure: During the cat isolated carbon,
linear carbon tails or small flakes are removed 


The letter in this document is for (my) internal use and indicates
the selection's center coordinates (Angstrom) within the 3D model (125x125x125 A^3).
